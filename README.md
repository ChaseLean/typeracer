# TypeRacer

TypeRacer is a simple math game using the Tkinter GUI. This is my first personal project written in Python.

## General info
The program will show a simple math equation on screen, and the user has to key in their answer.

Meanwhile, the health bar constantly decreases. A correct answer gains some health, while a wrong answer deducts some health. 

There are 3 levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium and Hard.
